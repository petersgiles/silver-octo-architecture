# Reporting

## Automate Charts

As a user of the system, I want to be able to have an overall reporting page, that is real time, is downloadable, is easy to read, where I can add/remove categories, and select specific timeframes. This will allow me to do my job better and understand other area's work load. 

MVP - Automate the charts Valdis resets every Thursday. CHARTSSSSSSSSS. 

Automate reporting and display in a easy readable fashion (e.g. Charts JS). 

Musts: 

- It needs to be download-able 
- Can select time periods (e.g.  Month prior, week prior, selectable time frame) 
- Also can select/unselect categories
