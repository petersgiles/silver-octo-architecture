## Change Notifications to specific briefs
Allow for 'your subscription' types to apply to brief level. 

As a user of the system I want to be able to sign up for the same notifications that are available for policy level notifications, but for a specific brief. E.g. Sent me an alert when a specific brief is workflowed.

This used to be about freezing the top pane of the brief subscription
As a user of the system I want the 'action' list to be a freeze pane on the adviser notification page, so when you scroll you can see read the actions at the top that you are signing the adviser up for.
