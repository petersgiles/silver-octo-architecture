# Concept Models

## What?

A concept model is a visual representation of a set of ideas that clarifies the concept for both the thinker and the audience. It is a useful and powerful tool for user experience designers but also for business, engineering, and marketing; basically anyone who needs to communicate complexity. Which is most of us, these days.

## Why?

If you wish to clearly present a set of ideas to an audience and represent how they fit together, a diagram is much more powerful than words alone.

## Here is a simple template to use.

1. What is the title of your document? If you donâ€™t know then ask yourself why you are making it.
2. Make sure to date everything. Since these will be printed out and passed around the office it is the only way to keep some sort of version control.
3. Give your diagram a lot of whitespace. If you cram things too close together than no one will want to take the effort to read it.
4. A central illustration in the middle of the diagram can help draw attention and acts as a focal point.
5. Under the central illustration put a description with additional explanation text.
6. Use callouts around the illustration to give extra detail.
7. Some of your callouts may be illustrations, too. Add notes underneath to clarify important concepts.
8. Use sidebars and bullet points as checklists, high-level goals, or other necessary information.
9. Pay attention to the size of things. Make important things bigger. This includes font sizes as well as illustrations.
10. Start out at letter size, then work up to legal, 11 x 17, and posters as the need arises.
