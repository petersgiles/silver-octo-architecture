[Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability](/assets/dont_make_me_think.pdf)

## Usability Means…
Usability means making sure something works well, and that a person of
average ability or experience can use it for its intended purpose without
getting hopelessly frustrated.

## Web applications should explain themselves.
As far as humanly possible, when I look at a web page it should be
self-evident. Obvious. Self-explanatory.

## Don’t Make Me Think
As a rule, people don’t like to puzzle over how to do things. If people who
build a site don’t care enough to make things obvious it can erode
confidence in the site and its publishers.

## Don’t waste my time
Much of our web use is motivated by the desire to save time. As a result,
web users tend to act like sharks. They have to keep moving or they’ll die.

## Users still cling to their back buttons
There’s not much of a penalty for guessing wrong. Unlike firefighting, the
penalty for guessing wrong on a website is just a click or two of the back
button. The back button is the most-used feature of web browsers.

## We’re creatures of habit
If we find something that works, we stick to it. Once we find something
that works — no matter how badly — we tend not to look for a better way.
We’ll use a better way if we stumble across one, but we seldom look for
one.

## No Time for Small Talk
Happy talk is like small talk – content free, basically just a way to be
sociable. But most Web users don’t have time for small talk; they want to
get right to the beef. You can – and should – eliminate as much happy talk
as possible.

## Don’t lose search
Some people (search-dominant users), will almost always look for a search
box as they enter a site. These may be the same people who look for the
nearest clerk as soon as they enter a store.

## We form mental site-maps
When we return to something on a Web site, instead of replying on a
physical sense of where it is, we have to remember where it is in the
conceptual hierarchy and retrace our steps.

## Make it easy to go home

Having a home button in sight at all times offers reassurance that no
matter how lost I may get, I can always start over, like pressing a Reset
button or using a “Get out of Jail free” card.
