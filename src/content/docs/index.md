DSuite Manifesto

 

General principles
•Write in our heads in pencil, love thinking, love learning, be very comfortable with being wrong and turn that into a learning experience – that is, be very open-minded.
•Don’t assume hunches are correct; ours and others. Seek to get evidence as quickly as possible. “Sincerely believe that you might not know the best possible path and recognise that your ability to deal well with ‘not knowing’ is more important than whatever it is you do know.”
•When we are wrong, call it out, consider if we want a log them. Be transparent about our mistakes – if we get a good decision machine going, there shouldn’t be too many, but accept there will be some.
•Avoid dealing with closed-minded people. If we have to, don’t get caught up in their modus operandi.
•The team should consider if we want to have an idea meritocracy - “A believability-weighted idea meritocracy is the best system for making effective decisions”. But we should be careful with believability, that is doesn’t stifle new ideas, wherever and whoever they come from. In this sense, believability is based on someone doing a similar thing successfully at least 2-3 times.
•Be happy, humble, fun and very friendly with our clients. Be the people that others want to talk to – very approachable and open minded. 
•These principles rely on debate and being able and willing to changing our positions, therefore we need to find a way to provide and receive criticism in productive way – Bridgewater refer to it as Thoughtful Criticism. The team should consider how it wants to do it, but here is how others have done it:◦Have a 2 minute rule, where people have 2 minutes of uninterrupted time to put forward their point-of-view.
◦When you get to a position where two or more parties can’t come to a consensus (notice you’re going around in circles), bring additional ‘believable’ people into the discussion. Concentrate on the ‘big issue’ and don’t get caught up in minor differences over minor implementation issues.
◦Try to identify if you have become attached to an idea for reasons other than for the logic of the idea – avoid attributing ideas to people, don’t discuss it as “Terry’s idea”. 
◦If you have a different point-of-view, speak up.
◦If these aren’t working, speak up or raise it with Nick ASAP.

•Produce as prolifically as we can while maintaining reasonable quality levels.
•Strive for efficiency – acknowledge it is very unlikely we are doing things in the most efficient manner; and therefore allow for enough time to consider and improve our levels of efficiency, in a continuous manner.
•Whenever possible, build goodwill capital and be willing to spend it. Use it as a security/deposit to take more risks.
•Identify our weaknesses – find something or someone to do what we are not doing well. Get believable successful people to tell us what we are not doing well. 
•Don’t tolerate problems, organise our time so we can find time to fix them.
•Innovation and great ideas are nothing if they are not well executed – spend time to plan the execution.

 

What significant projects should we take on? How we should do it.
•If it is not funded/resourced or we cannot drop something else, don’t take it on or schedule it realistically in the future.
•Work on activities that improve the information and knowledge base of our high executives; “Provide the Prime Minister/Minister with timely, clear and rigorous advice” is a useful rule of thumb/things that come from the PMO – noting above point. 
•Look to work on meaningful work with meaningful relationships. The team should define what that is, is it the above point and with open minded clients as well? 
•Seek and pounce on real opportunities. If it is a groundbreaking opportunity, swarm it to make the most of it.
•Avoid working on something that has low level of improvement. Try to work on opportunities that will result has significant and undeniable improvements.
•Establish a responsible person for each body of work. 

Analysis Principles
•Work hard to understand how the system really is working (warts and all). Look for the big problems and what the ‘real’ cause of those problems are. Work at getting all stakeholders to also be realistic about the problems and the behaviors caused by bad systems – so we have license to fix them and have a common goal in mind. 
•Spend more time going back over what we have done and seeing if it is being used in the way we had hoped – make sure these lessons learned are fed in to new developments.

Design Principles
•Aim for the absolute simplest possible design (technical and user interface).
•Get the views of believable people who are willing to disagree – if we don’t have believable people in PM&C on that topic, find them outside PM&C.
•Be as evidence based as we can in our design decisions, but don’t ruminate, once we have used a decision machine, have faith and implement.
•Don’t get attracted to shiny objects.
