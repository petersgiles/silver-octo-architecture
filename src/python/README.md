# Python tools for PlantUML

These are some tools that I have made for use in the weekly Python programming
handins, I am doing 2016-2018 at Lillebaelt Academy.

*These tools are a work in progress and updated on a regular basis as long as
I am using them in school.*

 * [**dbpuml2sql**](dbpuml2sql/): Convert database diagrams written in PlantUML into the
   SQL statements to create the tables.
 * [**dbsql2puml**](dbsql2puml/): Convert SQL CREATE TABLE statements into database diagrams
   written in PlantUML.
 * [**py2uml**](py2puml/): Generate a PlantUML class diagram from Python source code.
